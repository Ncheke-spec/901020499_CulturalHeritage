			<article>
				<h3>Mokhibo</h3>
				<p>This is a dance perfomed by wowmen or girls on their knees moving their shoulders, especially on big events just for entertainment. </p>
				<h3>Litolobonya</h3>
				<p>This is also a dance performed by the ladies wearing a "Thethana" that has beer lid on it for a perfect sound.</p>
				<h3>Mohobelo</h3>
				<p>This one is performed by gentlemen, mostly older. Other men sing a song called "Mokorotlo", then the ones on the stage move their feet in upwards direction all at the same time</p>
				<h3>Liphotha</h3>
				<p>This dance is usually performed by men but can still do too. It is usually for fun because it's very funny. The performers wear gumboots and beat them to make a similar beat or rythm also doing crazy things</p>
